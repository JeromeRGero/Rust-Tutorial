Just running through a very good tutorial on YouTube for [Rust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3AhzHq8ogs&list=PLZaoyhMXgBzoM9bfb5pyUOT3zjnaDdSEP).  

If you would like to learn more about Rust, you could check out the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html) or watch [this playlist of extraordinary videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3AhzHq8ogs&list=PLZaoyhMXgBzoM9bfb5pyUOT3zjnaDdSEP) on why to adopt rust, created by [Tris Oaten](https://github.com/0atman).
